# fix-it-felix
Get potholes fixed!!

## This is a website written in PHP and Materialize CSS and the backend is MySQL

### It works like this: 
* Take an image with location enabled on your device 
* Login and upload that image
* The website takes the location from that image (from the exif metadata) and stores it in the database 
* Contractors can pick up potholes nearest from them and fix them up. 
* Then after it is fixed the authority comes in and verifies the job. Then the request is closed
